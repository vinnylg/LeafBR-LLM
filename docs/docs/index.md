# LeafBR-LLM documentation!

## Description

LeafBR-LLM is a research project focused on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using drug package inserts (leaflets) from Brazilian medications. The primary goal is to create a structured corpus, called D-LeafBR, composed of official Brazilian drug leaflets, and to use this dataset to fine-tune and evaluate LLMs. The project explores the potential of these models to improve the comprehension of medical information by the general population.
